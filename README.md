# __HOMEVIO__

The Homevio website is a landing page for fitness enthusiasts looking for a trusted structured workout program, which is designed to help build confidence and proof. The aim of Homevio is to empower and to motivate users of ages 16 upwards to not let the comfortability of home stop them from working out.  

Users of this website are able to find information about the hand-picked workout videos on the site and can sign up there and then for a slot to gain access to soon to come content. This site is primary targeted towards gym enthusiasts as an alternative to not being able to go to the gym.
